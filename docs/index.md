# FinMAS - Financial Analysis Multi-agent System

This app uses LLM agents organized in a multi-agent system to analyze financial data
and perform financial tasks. The app is developed during the final capstone project of the
[WorldQuant MSc in Financial Engineering](https://www.wqu.edu/mscfe).

It is meant as a practical and educational app that demonstrates the state-of-the-art of LLM models applied
to tasks in the financial domain, and with an extra focus on open source models and packages.
