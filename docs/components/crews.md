# Crew - Multi-agent System

The performance of a configuration of agents and tasks depend a lot on which LLM model
is used for the agent executing the task. For example an Agent configuration can work
very well for `gpt-4o-mini` while for `llama-3.2-8b` there is likely another configuration
that will work better.
