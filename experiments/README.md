# Experimentation section

The purpose of this section will be to collaborate and share results of different tests within the team

## Multi-agents frameworks

A selection of recent and active frameworks for LLM multi-agent systems:

- [crewAI](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI)
- [AutoGen](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/)
- [CAMEL](https://github.com/camel-ai/camel)
- [MetaGPT](https://github.com/geekan/MetaGPT)

### crewAI

crewAI uses GPT-4 as the default model. Through the [LiteLM](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm) package, many other LLMs can be connected as well.
By using the ollama it is possible to run a local LLM together with the crewAI framework.

## LLM tools

The following tools can be used to work with LLMs locally:

- [ollama](https://ollama.com/)
- [LM studio](https://lmstudio.ai/)

This [LiteLLM page](https://models.litellm.ai/) gives a quick overview of the context length and model price for different LLMs.
